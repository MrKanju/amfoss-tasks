# Task 02
the task was intresting and informative initially i was a bit confused with the commands and how to use them but as time progressed i became confident and now im comfortable to intreract with the terminal.
# Commands I Learned :-

*`cd <directory_path>`: Change the current working directory to a specified directory

*`ls`: List files and directories in the current directory

*`grep`:Searches for text in files.

*`tree`:Displays the directory structure of the current directory

*`nano <file_name>`: Opens the default text editor for editing or creating a file

*`cat <file_name>`: Display the contents of a text file

*`echo -n <Base64EncodedStringHere> | base64 -d`: Decodes the Base64 code

*`git clone <url>`: copy's all the content from the hosted URL

*`git status`: shows modified files

*`git init`: makes it as a git repository

*`git add .` : adds all the files to commit

*`git commit -m "Example Message"`: commits your content, a message can be added to display in the commit log

*`git push`: pushes all the contents in the local branch to remote branch

*`git branch`: lists all the branches present

*`git checkout <branch name>`: switches from one branch to another branch
# Part 1
This part was easy i used tree/find comand to easily navigate to the parchment located site and using cat and .py i was able to obtain the first code.There i obtained another code that was not much of an use.
# Part 2
In the seconf part i navigated to 3 realms using brachs and git checkout command where i found a code in the light realm using the spell found using the holy and good herbs using grep.
# Part 3
The code obtaine from the light realm was then used to open the chests in the dark realms 1 and 2.
# Part 4
In this part i tried to decode the codes obtained from the previous 3 parts together and using decode it initially for i got the half link correctly after learning and changing a faulty code obtained i was able to get the repo link to the goldsuit repo which i later cloned.
# Part 5
Here as mentioned i navigated to each commits using(git log),it was a tiring job initially i had no idea later on i found the code and decoded it and got the link.
