# Task 02
the task was intresting and informative initially i was a bit confused with the commands and how to use them but as time progressed i became confident and now im comfortable to intreract with the terminal.
## Few commands that I learned are 
     cd (cd ..)
     ls (ls-a  ls-l   ls-al)
     tree
     find
     git comands(git clone, git config, git init, git add, git commit, git push, git pull, git status)
     branch commands(git branch, git checkout, git switch)
     mkdir
     cat 
     nano
