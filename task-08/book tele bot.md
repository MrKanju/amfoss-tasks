Project Overview: PagePal Telegram Bot
Objective: Create a Telegram bot that recommends books based on the genre provided by the user. The bot will fetch book data using the Google Books API and display details such as title, author, description, year published, language, and a preview link.

Tools and Technologies:

    Programming Language: Python
    Libraries: python-telegram-bot, requests
    API: Google Books API

Steps to Build PagePal

    Set Up the Project:
        Create a Python virtual environment and install the necessary libraries:

        bash

    pip install python-telegram-bot requests

    Register a new bot on Telegram via BotFather and get your bot token.

Integrate with Google Books API:

    Sign up for the Google Books API and get an API key.
    Create a function to fetch books based on genre:

    python

import requests

def get_books_by_genre(genre, api_key):
    url = f'https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=subject:{genre}&key={api_key}'
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json()
